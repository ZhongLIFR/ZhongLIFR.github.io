## Introduction

**Zhong Li** is a guest researcher in Computer Science at **Leiden University**, affiliated with the [EDA Lab](https://eda.liacs.nl/). I completed my PhD under the supervision of Dr. [Matthijs van Leeuwen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GGLwU28AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) (daily supervisor and promotor) and Prof. Dr. [Thomas Bäck](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=x7LEID0AAAAJ) (promotor). In 2024, I was a visiting PhD researcher at the [DAML](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/en/daml/home/) group, Technical University of Munich, supervised by Prof. Dr. [Stephan Günnemann](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=npqoAWwAAAAJ&hl=en).

📘 **PhD Thesis**: [Trustworthy Anomaly Detection for Smart Manufacturing](https://scholarlypublications.universiteitleiden.nl/handle/1887/4239055)

## Research Interests

My research lies broadly in **Data Mining** and **Machine Learning**, with strong interest in **AI for Math**.

### Postdoctoral Research
During my postdoc,  I am working on generative AI for Math, with a particular focus on:
- **LLM for Optimization Modeling**
- **Flow Matching and Diffusion Models**

### PhD Research
During my PhD, I focused on **trustworthy anomaly detection**, particularly for complex data like event sequences and graph-structured data in smart manufacturing contexts. My goals were to enhance:
- **Accuracy**: Improve performance with high-dimensional, unstructured, multimodal data
- **Explainability**: Make models more interpretable and human-friendly
- **Generalizability**: Ensure robustness under data shifts, unknown hyperparameter settings, and adversarial noise
