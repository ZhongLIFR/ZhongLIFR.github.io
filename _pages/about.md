My name is Zhong Li, and I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Leiden University, affiliated with the [EDA Lab](https://eda.liacs.nl/). I am fortunate  to be supervised  by Dr. [Matthijs van Leeuwen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GGLwU28AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) (daily supervisor, promotor) and Prof. Dr. [Thomas BÃ¤ck](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=x7LEID0AAAAJ) (promotor).  I worked as a visiting PhD researcher in the [DAML](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/en/daml/home/) group at Technical University of Munich in 2024, supervised by Prof. Dr. [Stephan GÃ¼nnemann](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=npqoAWwAAAAJ&hl=en).


Research Interest
======
I am interested in the field of Data Mining and Machine Learning. During my PhD, I work on **trustworthy anomaly detection**, with a focus on but not limited to complex data such as event sequence and graph-structured data for smart manufacturing. 

More concretely, I aim to improve the **accuracy** (namely make anomaly detection models more accurate, especially with high-dimensional, unstructured, multimodal data), **explainability** (namely make anomaly detection models more understandable for humans) and **generalizability** (namely make anomaly detection models work reliably under changing conditions such as data distribution shifts, uncharted hyperarameter configurations, and the presence of adversarial perturbations) of anomaly detection methods.
