## Introduction

My name is **Zhong Li**, and I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in Computer Science at **Leiden University**, affiliated with the [EDA Lab](https://eda.liacs.nl/). I completed my PhD under the supervision of Dr. [Matthijs van Leeuwen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GGLwU28AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) (daily supervisor and promotor) and Prof. Dr. [Thomas Bäck](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=x7LEID0AAAAJ) (promotor). In 2024, I was a visiting PhD researcher at the [DAML](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/en/daml/home/) group, Technical University of Munich, supervised by Prof. Dr. [Stephan Günnemann](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=npqoAWwAAAAJ&hl=en).

📘 **PhD Thesis**: [Trustworthy Anomaly Detection for Smart Manufacturing](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/events/2025/05/trustworthy-anomaly-detection-for-smart-manufacturing)

## Research Interests

My research lies broadly in **Data Mining** and **Machine Learning**, with a strong focus on **Trustworthy AI**.

### Postdoctoral Research
I am currently working on *trustworthy generative models*, with a central belief:  
> When generative models can provide insights into the data they generate, they should also offer insights about themselves.

Key areas of interest include:
- **Flow Matching and Diffusion Models**: What are they actually learning? How can we better extend these models for tabular and/or discrete data?
- **Understanding Unsupervised Learning**: Why does self-supervised learning work (or not)? How can it be improved?

### PhD Research
During my PhD, I focused on **trustworthy anomaly detection**, particularly for complex data like event sequences and graph-structured data in smart manufacturing contexts. My goals were to enhance:
- **Accuracy**: Improve performance with high-dimensional, unstructured, multimodal data
- **Explainability**: Make models more interpretable and human-friendly
- **Generalizability**: Ensure robustness under data shifts, unknown hyperparameter settings, and adversarial noise
