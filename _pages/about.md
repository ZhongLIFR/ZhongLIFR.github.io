My name is Zhong Li, and I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Leiden University, affiliated with the [EDA Lab](eda.liacs.nl). I am fortunate  to be supervised  by Dr. [Matthijs van Leeuwen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GGLwU28AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) (daily supervisor, promotor) and Prof. Dr. [Thomas BÃ¤ck](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=x7LEID0AAAAJ) (promotor).

Research Interest
======
I am interested in the field of Data Mining and Machine Learning. During my PhD, I work on trustworthy anomaly detection, with a focus on but not limited to complex data such as event sequence and graph-structured data for smart manufacturing. More concretely, I aim to improve the **accuracy** (with high-dimensional, unstructured and/or multimodal data), **explainability** and **generalizability** (when facing high sensitivity to data distribution shifts, Hyperarameter tuning, and/or adversarial input perturbations) of anomaly detection methods.
